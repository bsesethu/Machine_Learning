# ML Model Creation and Optimisation

My first foray into model development. Trying to optimise it so it predicts more accurately.

## Description

There are three modules present in this repository. Two of which are Zaio Live sessions, the other, energy_consumption.py is focused on the development of a model. This model is created from the dataset in the 'test_energy_data.csv' and 'train_energy_data.csv' files.
